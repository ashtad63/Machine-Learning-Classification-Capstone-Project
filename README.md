# Machine Learning Classification Capstone Project

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden \
voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. 

This **Titanic** dataset has many interesting statistics about who survived the shipwreck. It is well-known that women, \
children and the upper class had a better than average chance of survival.  

This Titanic dataset has a little bit of cleaning and data preprocessing. It will be used in two different roles: 
* First, it should be thoroughly examined using ***groupbys*** or ***pivot tables*** with Survived, Sex, and Pclass,\
in various combinations to find the percentages of passengers surviving from the different demographic \
groups. You might also choose to see if having relatives on board increased or decreased your chances \
of survival.  
* Secondly, this Titanic dataset is used extensively in the data science field for teaching classification \
algorithms. You will use this dataset with **Decision Trees, Random Forests, KNN, Logistic Regression,** \
and **Na√Øve Bayes** Classification. The goal is to see how well each algorithm performs for predicting \
whether a passenger survived the shipwreck. You will answer some questions regarding the results \
and ponder why some algorithms performed better than others, if there are significant differences.
